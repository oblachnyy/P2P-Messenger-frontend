## Install

```bash
npm install --save luxor-component-library
export REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY='...' # needed for Weather widget
```

## The Design Principles

### Container Based Design

The concept behind this design is using visual containers for everything. 
Whether it be a Box for simple content or a Stack/Row to align multiple Boxes of content vertically/horizontally respectively. 

The button component and weather widget are the beginning of a custom component library.

### Themes

Themes can be customized and you can add your own `theme.js` file. 
Use `src/utils/theme.js` as a template.

#### For working code examples of the library at work, look at the /example/src/App.js

# Component Documentation 

## Weather Widget

A note on the weather widget in that it requires an RapidAPI API key to function. Store the API key in an environment variable called `REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY` either with an export statement or in a `.env` file in the root folder.

Supply the `<WeatherWidget>` compoent with a city prop [more info on fomatting]() and any margin/padding/other props you would pass to adjust the a `Box` component. 


## Button Component

For the most part it's the same as an html button with a few added styles available via props.
- variant: ('solid'|'outline') where should color be placed?
- color: ('primary', 'secondary', 'error') which part of the theme's color scheme did you want to design the button with
- size: ('small'|'medium'|'large') size of the button
- text: string text that will be displayed on the button 
- any other CSS properties you would assign to a button
- `onClick` javascript event 

## Input Component

The  `Input` component supports the same fields as it's html counterpart.
- color: 'primary', 'secondary', 'error', 'default' | sets the color scheme of the input component
- size: 'small', 'medium', 'large' | sets the size of the text (and the input box)
- roundedCorners: (px|em|rem|...) | sets border radius
- width: (px|em|rem|...) | width of component
- placeholder: (string) | placeholder text
- variant: (optional 'solid', 'outline') | sets color scheme to fill or outline the component

```jsx
<Input
  color='primary'
  size='small'
  roundedCorners='2rem'
  width='500px'
  placeholder='This is a primary color, solid, small input field, 500px wide'
/>
```

## Box Component

The Box is the equivalent of a pre-styled div with all the css and js properties/functions can be applied via props.
The Box supports margin, padding, display, backgroundColor/Image... and any other `div` supported attributes via props.
```jsx
<Box margin='small' padding='medium', backgroundColor='red' color='white' display='block'>
  <p>
    Some paragraph text. 
  </p>
</Box>
```

## Stack and Row Components

Stack and Row components work in the same way but with different directions. 
Their main purpose is to organize `Box` components either horizontally (`Row`) or vertically (`Stack`).
- Both components accept the same attributes as the `Box` component
- space: ('small', 'medium', 'large') | Space in-between the child components of the Row/Stack 
```jsx
<Stack space='medium' margin='small' padding='medium', backgroundColor='red' color='white' display='block'>
  <Box>
    Some text. 
  </Box>
  <Box>
    Some text that will be positioned under that ^. 
  </Box>
</Stack>
<Row space='medium' margin='small' padding='medium', backgroundColor='red' color='white' display='block'>
  <Box>
    Some text that will be positioned in the left. 
  </Box> 
  <Box>
    Some text that will be positioned in the middle. 
  </Box>
  <Box>
    Some text that will be positioned to the right. 
  </Box>
</Row>
```
__you can also nest a Row inside of a Stack and vice versa to achieve a kind of grid stucture__

## Demo | Documentation
The demo (and conveniently live documentation) is available with a download of the [source code](https://github.com/jmoussa/luxor-component-library).
To run the live demo (screenshots below). Pull down the source code from github and navigate to `example/` and run:
```bash
>> npm install
>> npm start
```
**NOTE: If you do not have the package installed locally you will need to run the same calls from the root folder in a separate terminal**

---

## Development

- Fork the github repo
- Setup (RapidAPI API key needed for weather module):
```bash
>> npm install
>> export REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY='...' 
```
- Develop
- Send a PR

--- 

## TODO

- Navbar component
- Dropdown component
- Text input component
- Slider input component
